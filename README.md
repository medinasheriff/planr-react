Planr-react as requested by ehealth africa for my internship; is the react implimented 
version of a simple, lightweight web application for managing a list of field campaigns.

Inspired by PlanFeld, it features an overly-simplified version of the core campaign (aka Session) management activities limited to (1) listing of recorded campaigns (2) recording of new campaigns (3) editing of existing campaigns, and (4) deletion of existing campaigns.

Planr is to be implemented as a single-page application (SPA) with the operations around campaign creation, update and deletion performed via a modal form using a javascript library: React.
